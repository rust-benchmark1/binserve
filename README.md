# Features

- **Fast**: Binserve is [designed](#caching) to be performant, this is thanks to [**Actix-Web**](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) - one of the [fastest](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/) web frameworks out there and [**DashMap**](https://github.com/xacrimon/dashmap) for handling routes and the cache storage. (See [**Benchmarks**](#benchmarks))
- **Portability:** Binserve is cross-platform and portable to any major operating system, like it can run on your [Android](#portability) phone!
- **Routing:** Routing is simply matching a URI path to a file or a directory in a JSON file. (See [**Configuration**](#configuration))
- **Templating:** You can write templates and partials using [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/). (See [**Templating**](#templating))
- **Hot Reload:** You can reload your configuration (routes) and static files with no downtime.
- **Caching:** Binserve's performance is achieved due to minimization of Disk I/O operations at runtime (with `fast_mem_cache` enabled) and serving static files from memory. On the client-side, `Cache-Control`, `Etag`, and `Last-Modified` are utilized.
- **Security:** Prevents common attack vectors like [Directory Traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_traversal_attack) and [Symlink Attacks](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/132.html).

## Hello World!

Download the executable for your OS from [**Releases**](https://github.com/mufeedvh/binserve/releases), then just run it:

```sh
mkdir mywebsite/
binserve
```

On the first run, it will create the configuration file and a starter boilerplate for you to get started.

```
 _   _
| |_|_|___ ___ ___ ___ _ _ ___
| . | |   |_ -| -_|  _| | | -_|
|___|_|_|_|___|___|_|  \_/|___| 0.2.0

[INFO] Build finished in 295 Œºs ‚ö°
[SUCCESS] Your server is up and running at 127.0.0.1:1337 üöÄ
```

Go to http://127.0.0.0:1337/ and you will be greeted with the index page of Binserve.

Now all you need to do is to edit the `binserve.json` file. (See [**Configuration**](#configuration)).

## Installation

Download the executable from [**Releases**](https://github.com/mufeedvh/binserve/releases) OR Install with `cargo`:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/mufeedvh/binserve.git
```

[Install Rust/Cargo](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Build From Source

**Prerequisites:**

* [Git](https://git-scm.org/downloads)
* [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Cargo (Automatically installed when installing Rust)
* A C linker (Only for Linux, generally comes pre-installed)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mufeedvh/binserve.git
cd binserve/
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release
```

The first command clones this repository into your local machine and the last two commands enters the directory and builds the source in release mode.

## Configuration

The configuration file is a JSON file called `binserve.json` that's generated automatically by the executable. Configuring binserve is pretty straight-forward because the configuration fields are self-explanatory:

And all of the values here have secure defaults so you don't have to specify the ones you don't need.

üí° **TIP**: Most probably you wouldn't be needing all of the configuration fields, checkout the [Static Site Generator example](#static-site-generators) on how to serve a single directory.

```json
{
    "server": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1:1337",
        "tls": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1:443",
            "enable": false,
            "key": "key.pem",
            "cert": "cert.pem"
        }
    },

    "routes": {
        "/": "public/index.html",
        "/usage": "public/usage.hbs",
        "/blog": "public/blog/"
    },

    "static": {
        "directory": "public/assets",
        "served_from": "/assets",
        "error_pages": {
            "404": "public/404.html"
        }
    },

    "template": {
        "partials": {
            "header": "public/header.hbs"
        },
        "variables": {
            "app_name": "Binserve"
        }
    },

    "config": {
        "enable_hot_reload": true,
        "fast_mem_cache": true,
        "enable_cache_control": true,
        "enable_directory_listing": true,
        "minify_html": false,
        "follow_symlinks": false,
        "enable_logging": false
    },

    "insert_headers": {
        "x-greetings": "hellooo!"
    }
}
```

You can override the configuration with command-line arguments as well:

<ul>
  <li><code>-c/--cert</code> - The path to the TLS certificate for your domain.</li>
  <br>
  <li><code>-k/--key</code> - The path to the TLS key for your domain.</li>
  <br>
  <li><code>-h/--host</code> - The host/domain with the specified port for your webserver to run on.</li>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: <code>--host 127.0.0.1:1337</code> OR <code>--host zombo.com</code></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

## TLS

There is built-in support for TLS:

```json
{
    "server": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1:1337",
        "tls": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1:443",
            "enable": true,
            "key": "key.pem",
            "cert": "cert.pem"
        }
    }
}
```

The key and certificate can be generated with `openssl`:

```shell
# generate pkcs#10 key+cert (PEM):
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key_pkcs10.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 36

# convert the private key to PKCS#8 (PEM):
$ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in key_pkcs10.pem -out key.pem
```

## Templating

Binserve uses [Handlebars](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust) for templating as it's simple and the most commonly known templating engine.

You can register partial templates and template variables like this in the configuration file:

```json
"template": {
    "partials": {
        "header": "public/header.hbs"
    },
    "variables": {
        "app_name": "Binserve"
    }
}
```

**public/header.hbs**:

```hbs
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{{ app_name }} v0.2.0 Usage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/styles.css">
</head>
```

And use it like this:

```hbs
<html>
    {{> header}}
    <body>Hello World!</body>
</html>
```

Which would render down to:

```hbs
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Binserve v0.2.0 Usage</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>Hello World!</body>
</html>
```

## Static Site Generators

Every static generator builds your Markdown/Template files into a directory, usually named `public/`, all you have to do is point that directory as the index route:

```json
{
    "server": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1:1337",
        "tls": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1:443",
            "enable": false,
            "key": "key.pem",
            "cert": "cert.pem"
        }
    },
    "routes": {
        "/": "public/"
    }
}
```

That's it!

As mentioned previously, you don't have to specify all the fields, secure defaults will be applied! üôå

Pointing directories as routes is an intentional design so that you can host multiple Static Site Generator outputs easily. Let's say you have a portfolio as the homepage and your blog is made with a different template. You can just do:

```json
"routes": {
    "/": "my_zola_portfolio/public/",
    "/blog": "my_hugo_blog/public/"
}
```

## Portability

Binserve is cross-platform which means you can run it on any major operating system / devices. It is low on CPU usage and memory footprint so you can run it on your **Raspberry Pi** or even your **Android** Phone:

<div align="center">
    <table>
        <tr><td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mufeedvh/binserve/master/assets/binserve-android.gif" width="200"></td></tr>
    </table>
</div>

## Caching

With `fast_mem_cache` enabled, all files are stored in-memory mapped to it's route index and response on initialization and will not perform any disk reads at runtime. It is recommended to keep it enabled even if you have hundreds of files, Binserve automatically sorts large files to be read from disk. Only when you are serving lots of large media content you should disable this mode.

Under the hood, binserve maps the routes and prepares the response with the file's content, `mime` type, `metadata`, and the required fields to derive the `Etag` and `Last-Modified` tags beforehand and will not perform any of these operations at runtime. Upon changes to any of these files, hot reload is executed in a background thread which updates the program state by making changes to the [concurrent hashmap](https://github.com/xacrimon/dashmap) which manages the cache, changes are instant and wouldn't cause any downtime either.
